# Webx

**Webx** is an opinionated framework for building high-performance, maintainable Server-Side Rendered (SSR) web applications using Go.

It combines the type-safe power of Go with modern frontend capabilities, leveraging a curated stack of tools designed for developer experience and application speed.

## Core Technology Stack

Webx integrates the following technologies to provide a seamless development workflow:

*   **[Go](https://go.dev/)**: The foundation of the framework, providing a robust, concurrent, and high-performance backend.
*   **[Templ](https://templ.guide/)**: A language for writing HTML user interfaces in Go, offering type-safety and component-based architecture.
*   **[TemplUI](https://templui.io/)** (Open Source): A collection of pre-built, accessible UI components designed specifically for Templ applications.
*   **[DataStar](https://data-star.dev/)**: Examples of hypermedia-driven interactivity using the DataStar library (Open Source) or DataStar Pro (Bring Your Own License) for advanced features.

## Philosophy

Webx aims to simplify the complexity of modern web development by focusing on:
-   **Simplicity**: Leveraging Go's simplicity and standard library.
-   **Performance**: Server-side rendering for fast initial loads and SEO.
-   **Type Safety**: Catching errors at compile time with Templ.
-   **Interactivity**: Using hypermedia controls via DataStar instead of heavy client-side JavaScript frameworks.
-   **Developer Experience**: Providing a seamless development workflow with hot-reload and live-preview capabilities.
-   **Opinionated**: Providing a opinionated way of building SSR websites solving common ui problems with pre-built components and patterns.
